Welcome to the developer documentation of the [CustomDCBot](https://gitub.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot) by [SC Network](https://github.com/SCNetwork).

You can find details about how to use build-in-features here. If you want to learn, how to create your own module read [this section](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/#add-your-own-modules) of the [README](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/#custom-bot) file in the [official repository](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot).

This site documents how to use features in - for example - `/src/functions/helpers.js` or `/src/functions/configuration.js` or of some modules. Please remember to always document functions and classes. A workflow will automatically generate the documentation when pushing to the repo - please do not push your locally generated version, it will be overwritten anyway. 

If you want to learn how to document functions, please look [here](https://jsdoc.app/index.html#block-tags).

If you have any questions feel free to [create a discussion](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/discussions/new).
