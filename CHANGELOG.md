## v3.1.1
* Discord released their new way of editing slash-command-permissions ([read their blog](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots)), which made  a lot of features basiclly usless:
  * Commands can now only set a `defaultPermission` value
  * Commands can not set a `permission` field anymore, as it can't be synced with Discord's API
  * Removed the `arrayToApplicationCommandPermissions` helper function as it's not needed anymore
  * Removed the auto-generated documentation, as it was never really useful and didn't work
  * Bumped dependencies

## v3.1.0

* Made the bot actually work
* Code-Improvements, Bug-Fixes and clarification
* Added support for new module.json fields
    * `author.scnxOrgID`: Support for SCNX-Organisation-IDs (allows developers to accept donations and will show up to
      users in the dashboard)
    * `openSourceURL`: URL to the Source-Code of a module (licenced under an Open-Source-Licence; will show
      donation-banners in the SCNX Dashboard (if orgID is set) and qualifies (qualified) developers for financial
      support from the Open-Source-Pool of SCNX)
* No Developer-API for modules (apart from mentioned above) should have been changed

## v3.0.0

* Dropped support for message commands
* Module-Database-Models now always get loaded, even if module is not enabled (this allows to enable/disable modules on
  the fly)
* Database-Models can not be nested (because no one did that)
* CLI-Commands, Application-Commands, Events and other relevant data will now always get loaded, even if the module is
  not enabled (this allows to enable/disable modules on the fly)
* Every time an event or CLI-Command gets executed, the bot will check if that module is enabled and will return if not
* Every time application commands need to get synced, the bot will check if the corresponding module is enabled.
  [To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities](https://soundcloud.com/gamequotes/glados-to-ensure-the-safe)
  , this check will also get executed when a command gets executed.
* Errors in module configuration will only disable the module, not stop the bot.
    * üí° Errors in the built-in-configuration will still shut down the bot
* Module-Configuration will now only be generated on startup, not if configuration gets reloaded
* Added `disableModule` to helpers.js
* Improved `embedType` function
* `asyncForEach` is now deprecated, will be removed in v3.1.0
* Performance: To reduce the number of event listeners on `command`, every event used by every module will only once
  register an
  event listener. When an event gets invoked, the bot will run every registered module-event. To ensure fast
  reaction-times, this will get done synchronously.

## v2.1.0

* Added new concept of localization
* Updated modules to the newest version, including new features, localization and bug-fixes
* Introduced new helper-functions and database-schemes (including channelLock, DatabaseSchemeVerison)
* Introduced autocomplete

## v2.0.0

* Added new configuration-option `logLevel`
* Added logger (`client.logger`) to allow for more detailed logs (instance
  of [log4js.Logger](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-node))
* Added `--pm2-setup`-command-argument to indicate an [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)-setup
* Switched to discord.js version 1.13 which includes breaking changes
* Reworked some configuration-loading and switched to `jsonfile` as a dependencies
* Configuration of every module is now stored in a global client object: `client.configuration[moduleName]`. Please use
  this instead of using `require` as this method allows users to reload configuration.
* Commands are now slash commands. Old commands are not recommended being used, but can be by changing `commands-dir`
  to `message-commands-dir`. Remember, that in future we may remove this feature.
* It's no longer required to add `module` as a config-parameter for every command
* Added `sendMultipleSiteButtonMessage` to `/src/functions/helpers.js` to create fancy multiple-site-embed-messages
* `embedType()` now returns [MessageOptions](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/MessageOptions)
* `footer` can now be set for each embed individually
* `.eslintrc.js` added - please use this configuration if you create a pullrequest
* Added `client.logChannel` ([TextChannel](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/TextChannel)) which should be
  used as a default for log-channels and in which some relevant information gets sent. ‚ö†Ô∏è In some cases this value
  is `null` so always catch or check the value before any calls on this property.
* Forgot the prefix of your bot? You can now use @-mentions instead of your prefix
* `mesageCommand.config.args` now only (!) accepts an integer which represents how many arguments are at least needed
* Slash-Commands are now available and should be used as much as possible
* Errors in the executing of a command will nun result in a message to the user
