## Please read the [license](LICENSE) if you use this bot.

We really love open-source. Please read the license and follow it.\
In short words: You have to

* Disclose the source (Your source code has made available when using this bot)
* State changes (*every* change to the source code must be documented and published)\

Please read the full [license](LICENSE). This is not legal advice.

You may ask yourself, how this could align with our closed-source-version at [SCNX](https://scnx.xyz), you can find more
information about that in [this issue](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/issues/13).

## Support development

As mentioned above our business model is to host these bots for servers - it does not really make sense to publish our
product here - but we do it anyway - but we need your support! Feel free to [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
, [get a membership](https://membership.sc-network.net) (also on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/scnetwork)), or
donate [via Creditcard](https://scnx.app/scam) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/therealscderox). Thank you so much <3

## Need help?

Are you stuck? Please do not ask on our Discord (unless you are using our hosted version), instead ask in
the [discussions-tab](https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/discussions).

## Need something even more custom?

We are happy to give you a quote for individual requirements. Please email `sales@sc-network.net` with your
requirements.

[Add your own module (or API)](#add-your-own-modules)

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Run `npm run generate-config`
4. Replace your token in the `config/config.json` file.
5. Start the bot with `npm start`
6. The bot is now generating a `modules.json` and a `strings.json` file inside your `config` directory. You
   can [change](#configuration) them.

When reading thought the code, you may encounter code "tracking" / "issue reporting" parts of the bot.
This part is only enabled in the SCNX-Version and only used to allow users to see (configuration) issues of their bot
and to allow our team to detect bugs more easily (users can opt-out of that if they want to; we use the sentry-sdk for
that, but don't actually send any data to them, instead to our glitchtip instance - the open-source-version does neither
of that).
This open-source-version won't contact SCNX, SC Network and won't share any information with us, don't worry. You
can verify this by looking at the source code, which you should do before executing any code from the internet.

### Features

* Everything is split in different [modules](#modules) - you can enable, configure and disable it how you want
* Highly configurable - The goal with this bot is that you can change *everything*
* Add your own modules
* Easy configuration - Every config field has a description in an example file

### Configuration

You can find all the configuration-files inside your `config` folder. Every **enabled module** will have their own
folder with config-files inside them. **These files are generated automatically**. Every module has slightly different
configuration options. Every module has example files. Inside these files are more information about every configuration
option.  
Some config values also support [embeds](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html). This is the case
if `allowEmbed` is true.\
You either input a string (normal discord message), or an embed object with the following values:

* `title`: Title of the embed
* `message`: Message outside the embed (optional)
* `description`: Description of the embed (optional)
* `color`: Color of the embed, must be
  a [ColorResolvable](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/ColorResolvable) (optional)
* `url`: URL of the embed (optional)
* `image`: Image of the embed, should be an url (optional)
* `thumbnail`: Thumbnail-Image of the embed, should be an url (optional)
* `author` (optional):
    * `name`: Name of the author
    * `img`: Image of the author, should be an url
* `fields`: Fields of the embed, must be an array
  of [EmbedFieldData](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/EmbedFieldData) (optional)
* `footer`:  Footer value (optional, default: global footer value)
* `footerImgUrl`:  URL to image of the footer (optional, default: global footer value)

The footer of the embed is global and is defined in your global `strings.json` file. The timestamp is set automatically
to the current time.

### Modules

The bot is split in modules. Each module can register their own commands, events and even database models, so they can
do basically anything. Every module can register "example-config-files" witch are files with information about the
config file, so the bot can automatically check configs and do all the boring stuff for you.

### Add your own modules

As per the [License](LICENSE) you *have* to make *every* of your modules publicly available under the same license.
Please read the license for more information.

**Before you make a module**: Please create an issue with your suggestion and claim that you are working on it so nobody
is working on the same thing (;\
Also please read the [Rues for modules](#rules-for-modules).\
**Submit a module**: Simply create a pullrequest, and we will check your module and merge it then (;

#### Rules for modules

Every module should

* Use Slash-Commands wherever possible
* Should provide a file with exported functions which other modules can use to manipulate data or perform actions in
  your module (eg: an economy module should provide a file with exported functions like `User.addToBalance()`)
* Answer with ephemeral messages wherever it makes sense
* Create as few commands as possible (we have a limit to 100 commands in total), so please try to
  use [Sub-Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#subcommands-and-subcommand-groups)
  wherever possible (eg: instead of having /ban, /kick, /mute etc, have a /moderate command with sub-commands)
* Use the newest features of the discord api and discord.js (buttons, selects, etc) if possible
* Process and Store only needed user information and data
* Support localization (you don't need to translate everything, you only need to support translations, read
  more [here](#Localization)
* follow our [terms of service](https://sc-net.work/tos), [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/tos) and
  the [Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal). A module should not allow users
  to bypass or break the mentioned documents. This includes but is not limited to Nitro-Only-Features.

#### Localization

We'd like to offer SCNX and this bot in as many languages as possible. Because of this, we highly encourage you to use
translationable systems in your module.

* Localizations of not-user-editable strings: Use `localize(key, string, replace = {})` from `src/functions/localize.js`
  to localize strings. Translations of these strings happen
  on [Weblate]()https://localize.sc-network.net/projects/custombot/locales/
    * `key`: Key of the string (usually your module name, check out any files in `locales` to get an idea how this
      works)
    * `string`: Name of the string
    * `replace` (optional, object): Will replace `%<key>` in the source string by `<value>`
* Localizations of configuration-files and user-editable strings: You can specify field-fields like `description`
  , `default` and more in multiple languages. The bot / dashboard will choose the correct one automatically.

#### module.json

Every module has to contain a `module.json` file with the following content:

* `name` of the module. Should be the same as the name of your dictionary.
* `humanReadableName`: English name of the module, shown to users
* `humanReadableName-<lang>`: Replace `<lang>` with any supported language-code (currently: `de`, `en`); Name of the
  module show to users (fallback order: `humanReadableName-<lang>`, `humanReadableName-en`, `humanReadableName`)
* `author`
    * `name`: Name of the author
    * `link`: Link to the author
    * `scnxOrgID`:   [SCNX](https://scnx.xyz)-Organisation-ID of the developer (allows you to accept donations in the
      dashboard and will show up to users in the dashboard)
* `openSourceURL`: URL to the Source-Code of the module licensed under an Open-Source-License (will show
  donation-banners in the SCNX Dashboard (if orgID is set) and qualifies (qualified) developers for financial support
  from the Open-Source-Pool of SCNX)
* `description`: Short description of the module
* `cli` (optional): [CLI-File](#cli-files) of your module
* `commands-dir` (optional): Directory inside your module folder where all
  the [interaction-command-files](#interaction-command) are in
* `on-load-event` (optional): File with exported `onLoad` function in it. Gets executed when your commands got loaded
  successfully; at this point the Client is not logged in yet, so you can't communicate with Discord (yet).
* `events-dir` (optional): Directory inside your module folder where all the [event-files](#events) are in
* `models-dir` (optional): Directory inside your module folder where all the models-files are in
* `config-example-files` (optional, seriously leave this out when you don't have config files): Array
  of [config-files](#example-config-file) inside your module directory.
* `tags` (optional): Array of tags.
* `fa-icon`: Used for matching of icons in our dashboard. We will fill this out for you, please do not set this field.

#### `botReady`-Event and Config-Reload

If you plan to use the [ready](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client?scrollTo=e-ready) event of
discord.js to run some action when the client is ready, and you need to load some configuration-files you should use
the `botReady`-event instead. Please remember that this event gets re-emitted on configuration reloading. If you set
callbacks that get executed later or similar please remember to remove them on `configReload`. If you set intervals,
please push the return value to `client.intervals` to get them removed on `configReload` or do it manually.

#### Helper-Functions

The bot includes a lot of functions to make your live easier. Check out the file `src/functions/helpers.js`.

### Support for developers

As we earn some money with hosting your modules for users, we have decided to give you some (remember, we need to pay
for hosting) of this money. Here are the main ways to earn some pocket-cash with developing for SCNX:

* [Open-Source-Developer-Pool](https://faq.scnx.app/open-source-developer-pool/): We give you a monthly amount for each
  paying server using your module
* [Bounties](https://faq.scnx.app/open-source-developer-pool/#bounties): We giv you a small amount of money for merged
  pull-requests and contributions
  We support a lot of payout-methods, learn more [here](https://faq.scnx.app/scnx-referrals-faq/#payout-methods).
